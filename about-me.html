As a kid I cycled through a number of big dreams – at various points convinced that I was going to be a NASCAR engineer, medical doctor, and submariner – before I finally settled on pursuing astrophysics. After graduating from Boulder City High School in 2013 (and giving what I believe to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvyQVGbgEM8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the greatest salutatorian speech of all-time</a>), I headed off to the University of Oklahoma to do just that.</p>
                                
                                <p>The academic side of college was great, but I got so much more out of my time in Norman than just a solid grasp of physics and an introduction to Python. While at OU, I made lifelong friends, fell in love with my future wife, and got introduced to the crazy world of college football fandom. I may not have had season tickets during my freshman year, but by the time I graduated I'd been to thirty three games and traveled almost nine thousand miles to watch the Sooners play. I even made it onto ESPN a couple times:</p>

                                <p>Given how much I'd enjoyed my undergraduate research opportunities, as my time in Norman drew to a close I decided to continue on in academia and pursue a Ph.D., a decision which ultimately led me to The<sup>TM</sup> Ohio State University. Now, OSU has one of the best astronomy graduate programs in the country, don't get me wrong, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't almost as excited about getting to root for another college football blueblood as I was the research opportunities. Ultimately though, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/ohio-state-backup-qb-thinks-classes-pointless-because-170704817--ncaaf.html">unlike certain other well-known Buckeyes</a>, I did come to Columbus to play school, and despite the COVID-19 pandemic throwing a wrench in some of my best-laid research plans, I was able to finish my dissertation ahead of schedule and graduate within five years.</p>
                                
                                <p>Largely by accident, I also discovered my passion for photography while in graduate school. I've always been interested in nature and ecology – in fact I once got drunk at a party and ordered a cheetah textbook (that I subsequently read cover-to-cover) – so one of my favorite things to do when I had downtime was to visit the Columbus Zoo. Annual membership in hand, it didn't take long for me to get frustrated with the limitations of my iPhone camera as I tried to capture fleeting moments of interesting behavior. Eventually I decided to take the plunge and bought an entry-level Nikon camera with a cheap telephoto lens. What started with portraits of zoo residents quickly grew into a much more significant endeavor, complete with investments in pricier equipment and a number of wildlife-focused national park adventures.</p>

                                <p>I didn't stop at wildlife, though. In early 2021 I took my camera down to Bristol on a whim, figuring it might be fun to try shooting race cars as NASCAR tried running a dirt race for the first time in fifty years. While I was shooting from the grandstands as a fan that day (and naively using the fully automatic settings), I have since been a credentialed photographer for <a href="https://pitboxpress.com/category/gallery/">Pit Box Press</a> at more than a dozen NASCAR races and have filled in as a team photographer on several occasions. I have no interest in pursuing motorsports photography beyond a small part-time gig, but it's been a blast returning to my childhood race fan roots. Certainly makes for some incredible corporate icebreaker content, too. </p>

                                <p>After all, how many people can say that they've been on NPR to talk about star-shredding black holes <em>and</em> got to cover a nationally televised championship event as credentialed media?</p>
